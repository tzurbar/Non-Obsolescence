# repair and build DIY guide website
my main aspiration is to create a repairing and building guides for various products in an easy to use expandable website.
The goal is to give a new life to products and give people tools to build their own dream by their hands.
I also want the users to be able to add categories and product guides by an interactive page and parser. For that i want the categories and the product guides to be structured as easily expandable. I want to approve personally any product guide add before the parsering.
I want the website to be in different languages, such that the user can change the language. for a start i want it to be in English, Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.
I want to be able to add languages easily in the future.
I want the website to be compatible with phones browsers - android and Iphone. and it is important.
I want the website to be secured, especially the interactive page for adding guides. 
I think about user account management as part of the security and also as a more features service to the user, as saving product guides favorite and so on.

thats the main features :)
